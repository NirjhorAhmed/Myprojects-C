Sure! Here's a sample README for your C programs, especially tailored for the types of programs you've been working on — like file handling, image backups, scoring logic, etc. You can copy this into a README.md file if you're uploading your code to GitHub.

📘 README: C Programs by [Your Name]
👋 About
This repository contains a collection of beginner-to-intermediate level C programs that explore important concepts such as:

File handling (reading/writing binary files like images)

String manipulation

Loops and conditionals

Array handling

Custom scoring logic for quizzes

Backup generation and automation

These programs are written and structured to help understand how real-world problems can be solved using C.
🛠️ Requirements
A C compiler like gcc

Basic knowledge of how to run C programs in terminal or any IDE

🚀 How to Run
Compile the program:

bash
Copy
Edit
gcc program_name.c -o program
Run the program:

bash
Copy
Edit
./program
Make sure any required files (e.g., .jpg files for the image reader) are in the same directory.

🤓 Why These Programs Matter
These C programs are great for learning:

How to deal with real-world file types

Binary vs text file modes

Scoring logic (used in exams, surveys, etc.)

Dynamic file name generation

Memory-safe string handling

📌 To-Do (Future Additions)
Add file copy program to actually create 20 image backups

Add input validation and error handling

Add support for other file formats like .png, .pdf, etc.
